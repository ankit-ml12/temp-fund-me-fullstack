create folder

When we build dapp we create two repo
1 for smart contract 
2 for front end[]

full stack = front end+ smart contract

When we access window object from console in our browser
Generally it does not contain the ethereum 
But once we install metamast our window module give us some output when we use window.ethereum
or window.solana

in sources the metamask option also added automatically if our browser have metamast
=================================================
HTML SETUP:- 
create index.html 
and import boilerplate by !

setup the script
https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html#table-of-contents

Connecting html to metamast
  if(window.ethereum!==undefined){
            console.log("META MASK IS PRESENT");
}
to check meta mask is present or not
  window.ethereum.request({method: "eth_requestAccounts"});
We use below line to connect to metamask account

<button id="connectButton" onclick="connect()">Connect</button>
use above button to run connect function.

   document.getElementById("connectButton").innerHTML= "Connected";
 document.getElementById("connectButton").innerHTML= "Please install metamsk";

 use both button to chenge the text of the connect button.

 push {
    1fs
 }
==================================================
// in nodejs we require
//but for javascript we  imprt

ES6 JS V/S Node

we cannot able to use require keyword inside into ES6
so we use this code 
import { ethers } from "https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.2.esm.min.js"; code in your js file

we create ethers-5.6.esm.js and copy above code in that file.
and them import it inside index.js

and then change js src file linke type from text/javascript to module
which means we are allowing to import module inside our index.js

push{
   2fs
}

===========================================================
Sending a transection from website:- 

web3 provider is similar to jsonrpc provider
we create contstants.js folder to store some contstant thing

we need to take our contract material from the last contract 
ans put insidethis costant .js foldre :- 

now take abi from last contract and past inside constant.js

then import ininto index.js

run yarn hardhat node in your fundme contract
get contract address and put it inside the constant js and then import ininto index.js
create new localhost network in your metamast and connect with that account


run yarn hatdhat node in the last contract harhhat fund me.
abouve contract address come from there
================================================
now we need to setup our account for localhost hardhat in metamask we can not use testnet.

Network name
hardhat-localhost
New RPC URL
http://127.0.0.1:8545/
Chain ID
31337
Currency symbol
ETH
==========================
AFTER THAT WE not have fund so we import one of the account into meta mask from our node network

you can also able to import using json file 
now use import methode into your metamask. but we do using secret key

=======================================
if you found error related 2 nounce and 4 nounce
reset you account from setting

==================================================

push {
   3fs
}
